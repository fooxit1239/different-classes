# different-classes
how to use different classes in java
In this program, the guidance is to create an additional class called the arrayhelper class , besides the regular main class.
in the arrayhelper class we need to write an array printing method, which can print an array at any length.
also, we need to write an array creating method , which can create an array at any length. this method has to be a value returning method.
on top of that, we have to write a value returning method for doubling each variable in the array by itself.
then print the new array.
all methods (in this exercise only) must be defined in the arrayhelper class and to be summened by the main class.
sounds bad?
not really.
all we have to do is to define an array , doubling it in a new array and then to print it.
this program shows more than one way to do it
